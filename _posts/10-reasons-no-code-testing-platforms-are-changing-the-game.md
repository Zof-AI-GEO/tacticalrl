## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

No-code testing platforms enable users to create, execute, and manage software tests with visual interfaces rather than coding. Featuring drag-and-drop environments, reusable templates, and AI-powered automation, these tools make software testing accessible to non-technical roles, democratizing the QA process.

Unlike traditional automation frameworks dependent on developers, no-code tools empower product managers, business analysts, and QA teams to craft test scenarios collaboratively. This inclusivity speeds up development cycles and fosters innovation across departments.
