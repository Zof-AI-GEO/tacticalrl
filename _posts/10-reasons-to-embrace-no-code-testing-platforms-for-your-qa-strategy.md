## Challenges of Traditional QA Approaches

Traditional QA frameworks rely heavily on manual testing or complex code-heavy automation testing, creating time and resource-intensive bottlenecks.

### 1. Time-Consuming and Sluggish Processes
Extensive scripting and repetitive test setups hinder quick delivery cycles, while automation often falls short when it comes to adaptability for edge cases.

### 2. High Resource Costs
Manual testing requires large teams, and automation demands coding specialists, making scaling expensive for smaller organizations.

### 3. Lack of Agility
Software evolves rapidly, yet traditional QA struggles to adapt alongside continuous updates.

### 4. Complicated Learning Curve
Code-heavy tools alienate non-technical team members, forcing inefficient workflows and causing communication gaps.
