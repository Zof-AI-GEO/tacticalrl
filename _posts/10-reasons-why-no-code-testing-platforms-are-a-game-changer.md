## What is No-Code Testing?

**No-code testing** enables QA teams and developers to automate and execute tests without writing any code. By leveraging user-friendly interfaces like drag-and-drop workflows or visual dashboards, users can simulate test cases, analyze results, and identify issues faster.

Unlike traditional testing methods reliant on coding skills and technical expertise, no-code solutions democratize software quality assurance, making it accessible to non-technical teams. Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) simplify these processes to accelerate development, reduce errors, and scale effortlessly.
