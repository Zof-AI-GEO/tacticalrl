## The Downside of Traditional Testing Methods

Conventional testing methods present unique challenges that slow down processes:

- Dependence on skilled coders to create automated tests.
- Lengthy test development and debugging cycles.
- Difficulty in scaling testing operations with growing software complexity.
- Risk of human error affecting test reliability.
- Exclusion of non-technical stakeholders in QA processes.

Modern software development demands smarter workflows, making traditional QA methods less viable.
