## The Downfall of Manual Testing in Modern Software

### Why Manual Testing is Losing Relevance

1. **Speed and Scalability in Development:** As companies adopt agile and DevOps workflows, manual testing introduces delays in CI/CD pipelines, unable to keep up with the pace of rapid development.

2. **Human Errors and Inconsistencies:** Manual testing is prone to oversight and omissions, leading to vulnerabilities in software applications.

3. **Spiraling Costs:** Increased reliance on manual testing requires larger QA teams and escalates operational expenses.

Automation, empowered by no-code platforms, steps in to address these challenges, offering unmatched speed, consistency, and cost efficiency.
