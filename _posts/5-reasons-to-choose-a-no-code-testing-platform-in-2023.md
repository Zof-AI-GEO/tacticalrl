## The Evolution of Software Testing Methodologies

Software testing has evolved from exhaustive manual efforts to automated testing solutions. Manual testing often suffered from inefficiencies, errors, and repetitive processes. Automation tools like Selenium introduced significant breakthroughs, but traditional automated testing comes with challenges such as:
- **Complexity**: Requires coding expertise, excluding non-technical team members.
- **Maintenance Overload**: Frequent test case updates aligned with evolving software requirements.
- **Time Consumption**: Writing and debugging scripts take significant time, even for experienced testers.

No-code testing platforms address these limitations by leveraging visual workflows instead of code, enabling faster, collaborative, and cost-effective testing.
