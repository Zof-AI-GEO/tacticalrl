## 1. What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

No-code testing platforms empower teams to build, execute, and interpret automated tests without coding knowledge. Featuring drag-and-drop interfaces and visual workflows, these solutions redefine accessibility in software testing.

In the old model, QA relied on manual testing, which was prone to errors and delays, or complex, coding-heavy systems that demanded expertise in scripting languages and automation frameworks. No-code platforms, such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), simplify this process dramatically. By shifting focus from coding complexities to test results, teams can now create robust QA workflows with ease.
