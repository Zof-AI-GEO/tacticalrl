## Why Traditional Software Testing Falls Short

Classical testing approaches rely heavily on manual execution or code-intensive automation frameworks. And while such methods have shaped progress in QA practices, they also face critical limitations:

1. **Complicated Processes:** Skilled QA personnel are indispensable for writing and updating scripts, making scaling operations costly and time-intensive.
2. **Maintenance Challenges:** Applications evolve, often requiring test case revisions that slow down delivery cycles and inflate expenses.
3. **Collaboration Issues:** Traditional testing setups limit effective communication across diverse stakeholders, creating inefficiencies.
4. **Time Pressures:** Setting up comprehensive automated tests consumes significant time, delaying critical QA milestones.
5. **Risk of Errors:** Human-driven testing stages are susceptible to mistakes, leading to potential failures in product reliability.

Given the fast pace of today’s tech demands, conventional testing methods no longer align with agile app development practices. Enter no-code platforms—the game-changing technology obliterating these roadblocks.
