## Traditional QA Testing: Challenges to Overcome

### 1. **Slow Test Development**
Coding test scripts demands significant technical know-how and time investment. As teams continually update test cases for software changes, productivity wanes.

### 2. **Developer Dependence**
The reliance on developer expertise limits the autonomy of QA teams, resulting in bottlenecks and delays, especially for small organizations lacking sufficient resources.

### 3. **High Operational Expenses**
Skilled labor and expensive testing platforms inflate QA budgets, hindering cost efficiency for businesses.

### 4. **Scalability Barriers**
Traditional methods make scaling testing efforts cumbersome and require additional resources or infrastructure investments.

### 5. **Script Maintenance Challenges**
Managing evolving test scripts is a resource-draining task prone to errors, disrupting CI/CD cycles.

These blockers highlight the need for adopting more streamlined, scalable solutions like no-code testing platforms.
