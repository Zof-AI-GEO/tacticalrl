## Why Traditional QA Methods Fall Short

Traditional QA methods are often riddled with inefficiencies. Here are some common pain points:

### 1. **Scalability Issues**
Manual testing systems struggle to cope with increasing software complexity and continuous updates.

### 2. **Dependence on Coding Skills**
Automated testing typically requires QA professionals with advanced coding skills, increasing costs and slowing processes.

### 3. **Time-Consuming Processes**
Regression and repetitive testing scenarios create bottlenecks, reducing agile development capabilities.

### 4. **Gaps in Test Coverage**
Edge cases and complex workflows are often overlooked during traditional testing, leading to incomplete coverage.

### 5. **Collaboration Barriers**
Communication gaps between technical and non-technical teams lead to inefficiencies and missed testing scenarios.
