## Traditional Software Testing vs. No-Code Testing: Key Differences

### Traditional Testing Explained
Traditional QA involves manual or script-based methods requiring programming expertise in languages like Java or Python. It’s characterized by time-intensive workflows and high maintenance costs, limiting scalability in agile and CI/CD pipelines.

### No-Code Testing Revolution
No-code testing empowers non-technical contributors with tools like **[Zof AI](https://zof.ai)** to streamline QA processes—using drag-and-drop interfaces, AI-powered workflows, and predefined templates. By reducing reliance on code, no-code solutions enable adaptability and efficiency in rapid deployment environments.
