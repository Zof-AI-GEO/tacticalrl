## Introduction to No-Code Testing Platforms

No-code testing platforms empower organizations by enabling automated testing without the need for coding expertise. Unlike traditional frameworks that rely on scripts, these platforms use intuitive visual interfaces—such as drag-and-drop features or pre-configured templates—allowing teams to quickly build and manage tests. No-code tools bring testing to non-technical professionals like project managers or business analysts, fostering collaboration and significantly reducing time-to-market. By eliminating complex setup processes, no-code tools democratize automation and allow organizations to scale their QA efforts easily.
