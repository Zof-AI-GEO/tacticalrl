## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

Historically, software tests relied on technical experts skilled in programming. This often alienated non-developers from contributing to QA, limiting collaborative efforts. **No-code testing platforms** change the game by allowing users to build automated tests without coding. Features like drag-and-drop workflows, pre-configured templates, and integrations with CI/CD pipelines democratize testing, enabling broader participation in QA.

Whether you're a business analyst, product manager, or QA specialist, no-code tools allow cross-functional teams to contribute effectively to software quality without the steep learning curve of scripting languages.
