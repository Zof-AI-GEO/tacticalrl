## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

No-code testing platforms are tools that enable users to create, run, and analyze tests without writing code. With intuitive interfaces, such as drag-and-drop functionality and automated workflows, these platforms make testing accessible for non-technical team members, including product managers and business analysts. By removing the dependency on coding skills, no-code testing tools democratize QA processes, boost efficiency, and enhance collaboration.

Switching to no-code testing allows development teams to focus on rapid iteration, improving the application experience, and delivering high-quality products faster.
