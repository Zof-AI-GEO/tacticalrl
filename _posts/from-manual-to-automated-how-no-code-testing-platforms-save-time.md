## Why Manual Testing Holds Back Modern Development

Manual testing, while crucial for catching user experience issues, comes with significant challenges:

1. **Time Constraints**: Large test suites take days to execute manually, delaying iterative releases.
2. **Human Error**: Repetitive tasks cause mistakes, leading to undetected bugs.
3. **Scalability Issues**: Skilled testers are necessary, increasing costs as testing needs grow.
4. **Regression Bottlenecks**: Testing for code stability becomes exhausting when performed manually.

Modern Agile and DevOps methodologies require faster cycles, making automation essential.
