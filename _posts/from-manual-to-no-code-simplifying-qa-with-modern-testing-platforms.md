## Challenges of Manual Testing

Manual testing has long been central to QA, offering human insights into usability. However, today’s fast-paced demands expose its drawbacks:

1. **Time-Intensive**: Manual processes slow down testing cycles, particularly with daily or hourly software updates.
2. **Error-Prone**: Fatigue and oversight lead to missed corner cases and subtle bugs.
3. **Scalability Issues**: Multi-device/platform testing strains manual efforts.
4. **Resource Costs**: High personnel and training expenses impact budgets.

These limitations highlight the need for smarter, scalable solutions.
