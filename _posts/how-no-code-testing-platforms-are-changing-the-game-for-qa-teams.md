## Why Traditional Testing Approaches Fall Short

### Key Challenges of Conventional QA Processes

1. **Skill-Intensive**: Automated testing demands proficiency in coding languages (Python, Java) and frameworks (Selenium, JUnit).
2. **Labor-Intensive**: Writing, maintaining, and updating test scripts is time-consuming.
3. **Error-Prone**: Manual testing often leads to oversight and misidentification of bugs.
4. **Cost Heavy**: Recruitment and training of expert QA testers create a financial strain, especially for smaller organizations.

### Transitioning to No-Code Testing Platforms

No-code testing platforms revolutionize quality assurance by automating workflows and generating test cases without requiring programming knowledge. Instead of coding, QA teams interact with user-friendly interfaces to conduct quick, precise, and scalable testing processes.
