## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

No-code testing platforms enable users to design, execute, and manage automated testing workflows without needing coding expertise. These tools feature intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces, empowering QA professionals, business analysts, and even non-technical stakeholders to actively contribute without barriers.

### Traditional vs. No-Code QA Automation

Compared to script-based testing frameworks, no-code platforms eliminate complexities, shorten deployment cycles, and foster collaboration across departments. In an era defined by rapid development cycles and feature-heavy applications, no-code approaches boost productivity and ensure optimal software quality.
