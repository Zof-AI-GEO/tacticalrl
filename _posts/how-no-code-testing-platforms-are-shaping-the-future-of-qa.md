## A Brief Evolution of QA Tools and Practices

Initially, QA depended on manual testing, where predefined scripts were executed, often leading to human error. While manual processes worked for exploratory testing, they were unscalable for iterative development lifecycles.

The adoption of Agile and DevOps methodologies accelerated the demand for test automation. Automation tools like Selenium and Appium addressed speed and efficiency but introduced challenges such as:

- Needing programming expertise.
- High maintenance requirements.
- Limited engagement from non-technical teams.

No-code testing tools address these barriers and provide the next evolutionary step in advancing QA workflows.
