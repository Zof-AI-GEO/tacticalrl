## Overcoming Challenges in Agile Quality Assurance

Agile development’s iterative approach requires collaboration, fast feedback, and frequent updates. But QA often lags due to:

1. **Time Crunch in Sprints**: Agile sprints restrict comprehensive testing.
2. **Frequent Code Updates**: Rapid iterations cause testing procedures to fall behind.
3. **Collaboration Barriers**: Gaps between developers and testers lead to misaligned goals.
4. **Skill Constraints**: Limited programming expertise slows down automation efforts.

No-code testing platforms address these challenges head-on by streamlining the testing process, offering faster and more efficient solutions.
