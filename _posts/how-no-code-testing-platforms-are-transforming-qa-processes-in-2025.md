## The Current Challenges in QA Testing

Traditional testing processes often face:

- **Increased Complexity**: Applications with microservices, APIs, and AI require advanced testing tools and skills.
- **Lack of Skilled Professionals**: There's a persistent shortage of experienced QA engineers.
- **Development Bottlenecks**: Manual testing fails to keep pace with agile sprints.
- **Cost Inefficiencies**: Legacy tools demand expensive maintenance and staffing.

No-code platforms emerge as a solution, fundamentally changing QA testing by eliminating barriers and inefficiencies.
