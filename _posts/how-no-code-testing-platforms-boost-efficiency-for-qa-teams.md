## Typical QA Challenges Traditional Methods Present

For years, traditional testing methods have been synonymous with complex, slow workflows. Key limitations include:

- **Code Dependence:** Heavily relying on programming expertise slows test creation and hinders agility.
- **Tedious Test Design:** Writing and debugging test cases demands time and expertise.
- **Resource Strain:** Manual or automated tests drain human and computational resources.
- **Team Silos:** Code-heavy systems complicate communication between QA, devs, and stakeholders.
- **Lack of Scalability:** Traditional tools struggle to keep up with dynamic application growth.

No-code testing platforms help eliminate these bottlenecks, empowering QA teams to innovate and execute faster.
