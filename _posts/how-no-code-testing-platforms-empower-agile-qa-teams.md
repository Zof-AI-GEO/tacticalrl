## Key Agendas for Agile QA Teams

Agile QA teams act under time pressures while ensuring superior software performance. To excel, teams require tools that align with fast-paced Agile workflows. These criteria include:

### 1. **Rapid Test Creation**
Weeks-long traditional test creation must be swapped for instantaneous test-building to match evolving requirements.

### 2. **Agile Integration**
QA must align seamlessly with Agile tools like Scrum or Kanban to eliminate redundant manual efforts.

### 3. **Scalability**
Testing must handle complex software—across mobile, web, APIs—while balancing speed with accuracy.

### 4. **Inclusivity for Non-Technical Members**
QA platforms should enable non-technical users to contribute effectively.

### 5. **Actionable Data Reports**
Agile demands quick decisions, made possible via visual dashboards and analytics.

No-code platforms effectively fulfill these Agile demands, driving high efficiency in testing.
