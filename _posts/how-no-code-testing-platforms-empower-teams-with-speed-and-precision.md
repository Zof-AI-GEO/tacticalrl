## Why Modern QA Depends on No-Code Testing

In fast-moving agile environments, software teams must handle shorter development cycles while ensuring product reliability. Traditional manual or automated testing often slows progress due to technical complexity and time-consuming setups. 

No-code testing platforms simplify these processes, offering intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces to create tests effortlessly. They empower stakeholders from diverse roles—including product managers, designers, and business analysts—to contribute directly to testing, bridging gaps and improving accuracy.
