## Agile Development and QA Challenges

### What Sets Agile Apart?
Agile methodologies empower teams through continuous improvement, quick adaptability, and segmented sprints lasting 2–4 weeks. With an emphasis on speed, teams push forward incrementally—but QA often struggles to keep pace.

### Top QA Challenges in Agile
1. **Tight Deadlines**: Fast-moving sprints make extensive testing nearly impossible without innovative solutions.
2. **Frequent Changes**: Constant feature updates demand resource-heavy regression testing.
3. **Collaboration Complexity**: Developers, testers, and managers require seamless tools for alignment.
4. **Lack of Automation Skills**: Manual processes linger in many QA workflows, slowing results.
