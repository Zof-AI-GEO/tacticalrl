## Challenges in Traditional QA Testing

Traditional testing methods come with hurdles that hinder scalability in fast-paced development environments:

### 1. Tedious Test Scripting
Manual and coded testing demands significant time investments. Frequent software updates necessitate continuous updates to scripted tests, overwhelming teams.

### 2. Limited Team Collaboration
QA processes often function in silos, limiting non-technical team members’ participation due to a steep coding requirement.

### 3. Slow Adaptability
Manual methods struggle to keep pace with agile frameworks, delaying deployments and feedback cycles.

### 4. High Operational Costs
Hiring specialists proficient in scripting languages amplifies costs, making scalability more challenging for resource-constrained teams.

The limitations of traditional methods show a clear need for no-code solutions. Designed to simplify testing, no-code tools are transforming how QA teams meet agility and scalability requirements.
