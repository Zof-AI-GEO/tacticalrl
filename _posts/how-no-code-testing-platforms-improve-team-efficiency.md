## Overcoming Challenges of Conventional Testing Workflows

Conventional testing workflows create noteworthy challenges:

1. **Time-Intensive Processes**: Manual test case creation is laborious, often requiring coding expertise.
2. **High Maintenance**: Frequent updates demand constant attention to test script maintenance, diverting resources.
3. **Collaboration Gaps**: Communication hurdles between developers and QA teams create inefficiencies.
4. **Learning Curve**: Expertise in complex tools limits testing engagement across teams.
5. **Lack of Visibility**: Scattered approaches impede tracking, slowing decision-making.

These obstacles lead to slower release cycles, causing frustration and less agile workflows.
