## The Challenges of Traditional QA Testing

Legacy testing methods struggle with inefficiencies due to coding dependencies, time-consuming tasks, and high costs. Key pain points include:

### 1. Coding Dependency
Traditional automation testing requires extensive programming knowledge, leading to bottlenecks when unavailable.

### 2. Slow Processes
Manual testing consumes time with repeated checks, often delaying project timelines.

### 3. Financial Costs
Expert hiring, tool subscriptions, and post-release bug fixes amplify expenses.

### 4. Lack of Adaptability
Slow processes fail to meet the demands of agile development and modern CI/CD practices.
