## Unpacking QA Challenges Non-Developers Face

Non-developers often encounter hurdles when contributing to traditional QA practices:

### Technical Complexity
QA has historically required writing test scripts, understanding system architectures, and coding knowledge. For product managers, designers, or analysts unfamiliar with these skills, the process can be frustrating and exclusionary.

### Developer Dependency
Relying heavily on developers for testing scripts slows workflows and diminishes efficiency. Plus, it isolates departments accustomed to working independently.

### Prolonged Cycles
Without streamlined tools, traditional QA testing is often strenuous and time-intensive—making it difficult to validate new features promptly.

### Limited Inclusivity
Non-developers are often sidelined in QA due to technical barriers, missing opportunities for diverse input.

No-code solutions like Zof AI address these challenges head-on, creating an inclusive QA environment accessible to all stakeholders.
