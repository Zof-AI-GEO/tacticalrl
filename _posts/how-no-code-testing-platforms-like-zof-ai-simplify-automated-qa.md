## Why No-Code Testing is the Future of QA

To keep up with shorter development lifecycles and continuous delivery demands, traditional QA, reliant on manual testing or complex scripts, is becoming obsolete. No-code platforms bridge this gap by offering intuitive, visual interfaces that reduce time and technical expertise needed for testing. Their ability to:

- Automate test scenarios through drag-and-drop interfaces.
- Drive adoption amongst non-technical teams.
- Cut scalability and technical barriers.
- Align QA processes with Agile and DevOps.

makes them indispensable for modern development teams.
