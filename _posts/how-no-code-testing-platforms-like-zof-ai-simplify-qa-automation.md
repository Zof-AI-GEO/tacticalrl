## Challenges Faced in Traditional QA Automation

### **1. Complexity and Steep Learning Curve**
Tools like Selenium and Appium require coding expertise, making QA automation heavily dependent on skilled professionals and alienating non-technical teams.

### **2. Burdensome Maintenance**
Frequent updates to software UI often lead to broken scripts—raising maintenance costs and delaying delivery timelines.

### **3. Limited Team Collaboration**
The segmented workflow of traditional QA tools creates communication bottlenecks between developers, testers, and stakeholders.

### **4. Time-Intensive Setup**
Configuration and test setup using traditional frameworks can take days, disrupting agile and DevOps timelines.

### **5. Challenges in Scaling**
Traditional QA tools struggle to scale testing processes rapidly, especially during implementation of new features or increased workloads.

These challenges highlight the urgent need for innovative, user-friendly QA solutions like no-code platforms.
