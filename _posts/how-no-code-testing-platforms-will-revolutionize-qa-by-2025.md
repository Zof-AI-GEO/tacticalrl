## Current Challenges in QA Processes

### 1. **Time Constraints**
QA teams often struggle to keep up with rapid development cycles introduced by agile and DevOps models, making traditional manual testing impractical.

### 2. **Resource Shortages**
There’s a shortage of skilled QA engineers capable of handling complex coding tasks, creating bottlenecks for smaller teams or companies with tight budgets.

### 3. **Complex Software Systems**
Modern software comprises interconnected systems like APIs, SaaS, and cloud infrastructures, increasing the difficulty of error detection.

### 4. **Budget Overruns**
Lengthy QA timelines and costly testing resources often lead to higher expenses and delayed launches, impacting ROI.

These challenges underscore the need for faster, more cost-efficient, scalable, and error-resistant QA solutions.
