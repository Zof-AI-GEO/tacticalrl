## Why Time-to-Market is Vital in Software Development

Time-to-market impacts the success of any software product launch, influencing customer retention and market share. Yet, developers face persistent challenges:

- **Increasing Software Complexity**: Modern solutions require seamless integration of features, third-party services, and UIs.
- **High Expectations for Quality**: Users demand functionality, performance, and zero defects.
- **Inefficient QA Processes**: Traditional testing is slow, resource-intensive, and prone to human error.

To overcome these challenges, teams must find new-age testing methodologies that speed up workflows while boosting quality.
