## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms and How Do They Work?  
**No-code testing platforms** provide an intuitive environment for QA teams to automate software testing without requiring programming expertise. Through simple drag-and-drop setups, WYSIWYG interfaces, and reusable workflows, quality analysts can create robust testing solutions effortlessly.  
For example, modern e-commerce businesses can test purchase or checkout experiences with just a few clicks in these platforms—saving time and resources.   
  
### Key Capabilities of No-Code Platforms:  
1. **Simplified Workflow:** Design test cases using visual logic rather than complex code.  
2. **Multi-Device Support:** Test web, mobile, and APIs in the same ecosystem.  
3. **Modular Tests:** Construct re-usable components for expanding test coverage.  
4. **Seamless Integrations:** Compatible with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.  
5. **Enhanced Accessibility:** Empowers non-technical stakeholders to collaborate on testing.
