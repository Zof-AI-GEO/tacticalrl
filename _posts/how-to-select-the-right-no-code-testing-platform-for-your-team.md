## Traditional Software Testing Challenges

Why are teams transitioning away from traditional software testing? Common pain points include:

1. **High Time and Cost Requirements**: Manual test script writing demands significant resources, hindering innovation.
2. **Developer Dependency**: QA teams often rely on developers, leading to bottlenecks.
3. **Scalability Issues**: Scaling traditional frameworks increases complexity.
4. **Non-Technical Accessibility**: Conventional testing excludes non-developers, limiting collaboration.

No-code solutions address these issues, democratizing testing and enabling contributions from users of all skill levels.
