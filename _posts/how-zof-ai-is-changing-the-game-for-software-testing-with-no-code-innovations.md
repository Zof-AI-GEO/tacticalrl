## Challenges of Traditional Testing Methods

Understanding the hurdles of conventional QA is crucial to appreciating Zof AI’s impact. Let’s break down some common issues:

### 1. **High Technical Complexity**
Writing and maintaining test scripts often requires programming expertise. Non-technical teams struggle with these complex methods, causing bottlenecks and delays.

### 2. **Inadequate Efficiency and Scalability**
Manual testing is slow and resource-heavy, while automated tools that require scripts often fail to keep up with the rapid pace of agile methodologies. Scaling QA efforts under such conditions becomes daunting.

### 3. **Cost and Resource Limitations**
Smaller teams and startups face financial and manpower challenges that limit their ability to perform robust testing affordably.

### 4. **Difficulty Integrating with Modern Tech Stacks**
Traditional QA systems rarely integrate smoothly with CI/CD pipelines or cloud-based environments, posing additional challenges for DevOps teams.
