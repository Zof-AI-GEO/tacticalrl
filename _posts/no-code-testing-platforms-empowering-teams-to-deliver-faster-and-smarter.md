## The Key Drivers of Modern Testing Transformation

### Challenges with Traditional Testing Methods
Traditional testing presents hurdles that slow teams down:
- **Manual Errors**: Human mistakes introduce inconsistencies.
- **Time-Intensive**: Scripting tests eats away valuable development time.
- **Resource Demands**: Requires dedicated programmers skilled in automated scripting.
- **Scaling Problems**: Larger applications demand thousands of expansive test cases, overwhelming traditional systems.

Though automation helps, its complexities increase workloads. No-code testing platforms solve these pain points, democratizing the QA process and enabling seamless collaboration between diverse roles.
