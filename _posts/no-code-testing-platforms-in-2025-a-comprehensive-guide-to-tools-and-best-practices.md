## No-Code in Software Testing: The 2025 Revolution

Traditionally, software testing needed a high degree of programming expertise. Developers spent hours scripting test cases, building automation frameworks, and troubleshooting bugs in Python, Java, or similar programming languages. Non-coders found it difficult to contribute to the process.

Thanks to the rise of no-code tools in 2025, the barriers have been shattered. These tools include intuitive interfaces, visual workflows, and AI-driven adaptability, redefining software testing and enabling everyone in an organization to contribute efficiently.
