## Why Agile and DevOps Teams Thrive with No-Code Testing

### Speed and Adaptability
Traditional testing methods are labor-intensive and slow the delivery pipeline. No-code platforms let users create test workflows visually without coding, encouraging collaboration across technical and non-technical teams. Agile and DevOps teams benefit from accelerated testing and minimized roadblocks.

### CI/CD Integration for Automation
DevOps depends on smooth integration within CI/CD pipelines. No-code platforms enhance automation with rapid trigger responses and feedback loops on every build. Their intuitive nature ensures efficient testing without compromising quality.
