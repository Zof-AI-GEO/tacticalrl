## Challenges of Manual Testing in QA

### **1. Time Inefficiency**
Manual testing requires extensive hours or weeks to thoroughly execute test cases, leading to project delays and struggles to meet agile development timelines.

### **2. High Costs**
Banks of QA engineers and infrastructure skyrocket testing expenses, stretching enterprise budgets thin.

### **3. Human Error**
Tedious manual tasks result in missed bugs, inconsistencies, and risks to software quality.

### **4. Poor Scalability**
Expansive applications demand more testers, driving costs up further.

### **5. Delayed Feedback Loops**
Slow issue detection stalls iterative workflows, impacting product release schedules.

No-code platforms eliminate these inefficiencies, presenting QA teams with a game-changing opportunity for improvement.
