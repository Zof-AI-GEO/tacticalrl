## Overcoming Traditional QA Challenges 

### High Dependency on Technical Skills 
Most automated testing tools demand expertise in programming languages, which can slow team productivity and inflate costs for onboarding specialized developers. 

### Tedious Test Creation & Maintenance 
Complex scripts for traditional tools require frequent updates, creating bottlenecks as software evolves. Maintaining these tests is labor-intensive and prone to human error. 

### Collaboration Barriers 
Traditional tools primarily cater to developers, leaving out product managers or designers. This lack of collaboration slows QA processes and risks misalignment among teams. 

No-code platforms like Zof AI address these challenges by offering intuitive interfaces and AI features that adapt to software changes in real-time.
