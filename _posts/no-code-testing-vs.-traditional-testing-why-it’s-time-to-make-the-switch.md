## Challenges of Traditional Testing

Old-school testing, requiring manual scripting and programming expertise, comes with several hurdles:

- **High Skill Dependency**: Demands proficiency in programming languages and QA frameworks.
- **Time-Intensive**: Writing and maintaining scripts slows down processes.
- **Complex Maintenance**: Frequent updates needed to keep up with evolving applications.
- **Costly**: Requires investment in skilled personnel, dedicated testing environments, and more.
- **Limited Collaboration**: Excludes non-technical stakeholders from contributing meaningfully to QA.

These challenges, coupled with agile demands, make traditional testing a bottleneck, creating an urgent need for scalable solutions like no-code platforms.
