## No-Code vs Traditional Testing: Understanding the Basics

### What is Traditional Testing?
Traditional testing is a highly customizable, coding-intensive process where experienced developers write test scripts using programming languages or automation frameworks like Selenium or Appium. It excels in tackling complex scenarios but requires significant time investment and technical expertise.

### What is No-Code Testing?
No-code testing enables teams to automate processes without coding knowledge. Leveraging intuitive interfaces like visual workflows and drag-and-drop tools, platforms such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) make automation accessible, empowering non-technical members to collaborate and streamline the QA process effortlessly.

### Comparative Overview
| **Aspect**            | **Traditional Testing**               | **No-Code Testing**                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Expertise Needed**   | High – coding and scripting skills   | Low – accessible to non-technical users  |
| **Customizability**    | Highly customizable                  | Limited workflows                        |
| **Ease of Use**        | Relatively complex                   | User-friendly                            |
| **Cost**               | Expensive due to trained expertise   | Cost-effective and scalable              |
| **Speed**              | Slower setup, time-intensive         | Faster execution with minimal setup      |
