## Traditional QA Testing Methods: Challenges and Constraints

For decades, traditional QA testing has played a pivotal role in ensuring software quality. However, it often struggles to keep pace with the demands of modern development. Here are the main challenges:

### 1. **Manual Testing**
Manual testing involves human effort to execute test steps. While customizable, it’s prone to human error, time-consuming, and difficult to scale.

### 2. **Scripted Automation Testing**
Automation tools like Selenium and Appium use detailed scripts written in programming languages. While efficient for repetitive testing, they require advanced technical skills from QA engineers, limiting their accessibility to non-technical teams.

### 3. **Dependence on QA Teams**
Traditional testing centralizes QA responsibilities within specialized teams. This lack of collaboration between QA, developers, and other departments often results in bottlenecks.

### 4. **Maintenance Overheads**
Test scripts demand frequent updates to match changes in the software, leading to increased costs and extended timelines.

Traditional testing methods deliver precision but devour significant resources and fail to support the agile demands of today’s software development cycles.
