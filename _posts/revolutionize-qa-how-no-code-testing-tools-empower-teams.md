## Challenges in Traditional QA Workflows

Traditional QA methods often hinder productivity due to technical complexity, manual workflows, and scalability issues:

### **1. Coding Dependency in Tests**  
Conventional QA frameworks rely heavily on technical expertise to write, execute, and maintain test scripts—often leading to bottlenecks for teams lacking engineering resources.

### **2. Manual Testing Inefficiencies**  
Time-consuming and error-prone, manual testing disrupts workflows, slowing delivery schedules and reducing QA teams' focus on high-value tasks.

### **3. Scalability Issues**  
The exponential growth of test scripts needed for complex apps makes scaling QA processes resource-intensive and tedious.

### **4. Communication Breakdown**  
Gaps in communication between developers and QA teams hinder seamless collaboration, often elongating bug replication cycles.

These pain points illustrate the urgent need for agile, cost-effective solutions that align with modern development speeds—solutions that no-code testing tools provide.
