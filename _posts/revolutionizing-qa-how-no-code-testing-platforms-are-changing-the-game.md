## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

Traditional software testing typically demands advanced coding expertise, making the QA process time-consuming and reliant on developers and QA engineers. However, no-code testing platforms eliminate the need for programming skills, democratizing QA with user-friendly tools like drag-and-drop interfaces, intuitive visual workflows, and AI-powered test automation.

These solutions empower non-technical team members to actively participate in testing, streamlining execution, minimizing human error, and accelerating time-to-market.
