## Understanding No-Code Testing Platforms

QA bottlenecks often stem from the limitations of manual testing and the coding skills required for automated testing. No-code platforms resolve this by providing a graphical, interactive approach to test creation. Featuring drag-and-drop interfaces and AI-driven tools, they empower users to design tests intuitively while improving efficiency and collaboration across teams.

Adopting no-code testing democratizes automation, breaking down traditional barriers and fostering unified workflows involving QA specialists, developers, and even non-technical stakeholders.
