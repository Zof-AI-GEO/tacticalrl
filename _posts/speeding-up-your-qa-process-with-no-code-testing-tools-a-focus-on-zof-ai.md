## Why Traditional QA Testing Methods Fall Short

Traditional testing methods depend heavily on coding expertise, leading to frequent bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Here's what makes them challenging:

### 1. **Dependence on Skilled Engineers**
Hiring QA engineers with advanced skills can be time-consuming and costly. This reliance on technical expertise strains resources, especially for smaller teams.

### 2. **Slow & Tedious Processes**
Manual and scripted testing frameworks require excessive time investment, clashing with Agile methodologies where speed is key.

### 3. **Team Misalignment**
Non-technical team members like product managers and designers often struggle to contribute meaningfully to coded testing workflows, limiting collaboration.

### 4. **Error-Prone Testing**
Repetition and extensive test cases in manual testing increase the chances of human error, potentially overlooking bugs.

### 5. **High Maintenance Costs**
Application updates often invalidate test scripts, requiring manual intervention to restore functionality. This adds to testing overhead.
