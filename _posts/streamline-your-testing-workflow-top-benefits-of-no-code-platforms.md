## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

No-code testing platforms are innovative tools designed to enable users—whether technical or non-technical—to create, execute, and manage tests without writing a single line of code. With intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built components, and smart automation features, these platforms democratize the testing process, eliminating the barriers associated with manual coding.

They allow manual testers, project managers, and QA teams to focus on designing effective testing strategies without needing an in-depth technical background. Whether it’s web, API, or integration testing, no-code platforms empower diverse teams to enhance workflows while keeping up with the pace of agile development.
