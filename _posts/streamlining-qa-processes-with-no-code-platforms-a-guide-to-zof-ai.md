## The Most Pressing QA Challenges

The QA field involves diverse tasks such as manual test execution, automation, bug reporting, and user acceptance testing. These workflows often face hurdles, including:

### 1. **Limited Resources**
   Crafting and maintaining test scripts demands skilled developers who are often scarce in agile environments with tight schedules.

### 2. **Scaling Dilemmas**
   Expanding test coverage grows exponentially with software complexity. Traditional coding methods become a time and resource burden.

### 3. **Collaboration Problems**
   Non-technical stakeholders find it difficult to interpret complex code-based testing. Communication gaps between technical and non-technical teams extend timelines.

### 4. **High Automation Costs**
   Conventional automation frameworks come with high upfront costs for tools and require continuous maintenance for evolving tech environments.
