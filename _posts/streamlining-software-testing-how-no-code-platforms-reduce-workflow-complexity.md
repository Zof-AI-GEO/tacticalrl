## Traditional Testing Challenges: What Holds QA Teams Back?

### **1. Time-Consuming Setup and Maintenance**
Testers using conventional systems like Selenium or JUnit often face the monumental task of creating and maintaining intricate scripts. As software evolves, these scripts demand regular updates, creating bottlenecks that drain valuable time and resources.

### **2. Lack of Cross-Team Collaboration**
Non-technical stakeholders often find it difficult to participate in traditional QA processes. This disconnect results in inefficiencies, silos, and missed opportunities for teamwork.

### **3. Rigid and Expensive Frameworks**
Costs mount as organizations invest in maintaining complex testing frameworks, while delays caused by factors like debugging reduce time available for innovation.
