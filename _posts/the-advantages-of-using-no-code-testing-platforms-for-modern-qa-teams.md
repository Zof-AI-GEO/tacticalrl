## What are No-Code Testing Platforms?

No-code testing platforms make software testing accessible to all by removing the need for complex coding. They offer intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces, visual workflows, and automation tools that enable non-technical team members to contribute to QA processes with ease. 

Traditionally, software testing required advanced programming skills, placing the burden on experienced QA engineers or developers. No-code platforms, however, democratize testing, empowering product managers, business analysts, and junior QA staff to actively participate in tests and uncover bugs without requiring coding expertise.

These platforms also offer scalability, faster implementation, and adaptability—qualities crucial for keeping up in today’s fast-evolving development landscape.
