## Why Traditional Testing Is No Longer Enough

### Key Limitations of Manual and Scripted Testing:
- **Time Consumption:** Manual testing demands effort and becomes unwieldy for complex applications. Automation scripts require coding expertise and frequent updates.
- **Inefficiency:** Skilled testers are required, making scaling for resource-limited teams difficult.
- **Dynamic Challenges:** Automation scripts falter when applications rapidly evolve.
- **Agility Incompatibility:** Rigorous testing pipelines aren’t suited for fast-paced DevOps or agile methodologies.

The demand for faster, adaptive approaches paves the way for innovation, specifically **no-code testing platforms** that alleviate these constraints.
