## The Shift in QA Testing: From Manual to No-Code Automation

Quality assurance methods have undergone significant changes over time. At first, manual testing processes dominated but were fraught with time-consuming and error-prone practices. Traditional automation testing tools like Selenium introduced scripting to automate repetitive tasks, yet they demanded strong programming skills.

With methodologies like Agile and DevOps, QA took on a proactive role throughout software development cycles. However, even advanced automated tools struggled to overcome the bottlenecks caused by technical complexities, stringent maintenance requirements, and resource-heavy workflows.

Today, no-code solutions—especially platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai)—usher in a new era of QA automation. Built to democratize testing, these platforms make it accessible to both technical experts and non-specialized team members.
