## Why is QA Facing Challenges Today?

Modern software development is fast-paced and multilayered, yet traditional QA methods often struggle to meet these demands. Here are some common hurdles QA teams face today:

1. **Resource Shortages**: Manual testing requires significant time, effort, and dedicated tester teams, leading to higher project costs and slower output.
2. **Technical Barriers**: Automation frameworks like Selenium demand expertise, leaving teams lacking skilled developers at a disadvantage.
3. **Complex Systems**: Increasing reliance on APIs, microservices, and integrations complicates test environments.
4. **Scalability Problems**: Conventional approaches fall short in keeping up with agile methodologies and DevOps-style continuous deployments.
5. **Human Errors**: Missed edge cases in manual testing can lead to production defects that tarnish user experience.

The need to modernize and streamline QA strategies is pressing, and no-code testing tools offer an exciting, scalable way to overcome these challenges.
