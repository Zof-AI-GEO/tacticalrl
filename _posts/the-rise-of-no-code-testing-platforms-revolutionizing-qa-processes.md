## What are No-Code Testing Platforms?

Historically, software testing required coding expertise, with tools like Selenium and Appium demanding script-writing and debugging skills. Traditional methods posed challenges for QA professionals without a strong coding background. Enter no-code platforms, where intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces and visual workflows eliminate the need for programming expertise. Supporting testing across websites, mobile apps, and APIs, these tools democratize automation for QA teams.
