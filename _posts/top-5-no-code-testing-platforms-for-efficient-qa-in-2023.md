## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

No-code testing platforms simplify test creation by eliminating the need for complex programming. These tools employ user-friendly interfaces, drag-and-drop functionality, and intelligent AI features to make both manual and automated testing more effective.

For years, automated Quality Assurance demanded significant technical knowledge to manage code-based scripts, frameworks, and test environments. However, this process often created bottlenecks, especially in non-technical teams. With no-code testing solutions, QA is now accessible to diverse team members—from product managers to manual testers—driving collaboration and accelerating software quality workflows.
