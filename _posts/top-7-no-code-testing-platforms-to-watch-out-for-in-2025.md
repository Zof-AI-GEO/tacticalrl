## What Are No-Code Testing Platforms?

No-code testing platforms enable users to automate QA processes without programming proficiency. Traditionally, automation relied on scripting languages like Python or Java, requiring time, expertise, and resources. The no-code approach simplifies software testing with visual workflows, drag-and-drop interfaces, and pre-built testing actions, empowering non-technical users to create robust test scenarios.
