## Common Challenges with Traditional Testing Methods

Traditional testing approaches often hinder QA efficiency. Here are some notable obstacles they present:

### 1. **Complex Learning Curve**
Traditional testing tools often require proficiency in programming languages such as Python or Java, creating steep learning curves for non-technical personnel.

### 2. **Resource-Intensive Processes**
Developing, debugging, and maintaining test scripts can consume significant time and resources, slowing project timelines and increasing costs.

### 3. **High Costs**
Hiring skilled developers or QA professionals, alongside maintaining technical infrastructure, often strains budgets.

### 4. **Restricted Collaboration**
Technical complexities can isolate QA teams from other stakeholders, limiting cross-department collaboration and innovation.

### 5. **Low Accessibility for Non-Technical Roles**
Product managers or business analysts often face difficulties contributing to detailed testing workflows due to technical limitations.
