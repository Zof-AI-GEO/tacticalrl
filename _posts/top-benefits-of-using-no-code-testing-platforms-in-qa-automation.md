## Why QA Automation (and Its Challenges) Needs a Change

QA automation is essential for reducing human error, speeding up testing, and increasing accuracy. But traditional methods—relying on scripting—often face roadblocks:

1. **Coding Challenges**: Teams need programming expertise to create and maintain automated tests.
2. **Constant Updates**: Test scripts break frequently due to app changes, needing ongoing revisions.
3. **Time Drain**: Debugging scripts and crafting test cases slow down agile workflows.
4. **Budget Concerns**: Advanced frameworks and technical staff can inflate operational spending.

So, how do no-code platforms transform these problems into opportunities?
