## Challenges With Traditional Testing Workflows
Before no-code platforms gained popularity, testing processes commonly involved:
- **Time-Consuming Test Creation:** Developers faced hours of scripting with tools like Selenium.
- **Collaboration Barriers:** Non-technical teams couldn’t effectively contribute to testing.
- **Fragile Test Environments:** Automated test scripts often broke with minor application changes.
- **Scalability Issues:** Scaling testing processes was resource-intensive as applications grew.
