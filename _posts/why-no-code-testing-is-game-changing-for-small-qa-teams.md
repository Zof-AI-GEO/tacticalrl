## Key Challenges Small QA Teams Encounter

### 1. Limited Resources 
With fewer team members and small budgets, achieving comprehensive testing coverage becomes daunting for small QA teams.

### 2. Lack of Technical Expertise 
Traditional testing tools require specialized skills, which many small teams struggle to acquire.

### 3. Time Constraints 
Manual testing eats up valuable time, making it hard to sync with fast-paced development cycles.

### 4. Scaling Complex Testing 
Growing product demands mean scaling QA efforts without sacrificing productivity is challenging.

### 5. Collaboration Hurdles 
Efficient communication between QA and developers is often hindered by outdated processes and limited tools.
