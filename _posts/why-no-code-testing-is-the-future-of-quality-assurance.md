## Overcoming Challenges with Traditional Quality Assurance Methods

### 1. **Heavy Dependence on Coding Skills**
Traditional testing requires deep technical knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-engineering teams and increasing resource costs.

### 2. **Delayed Development Timelines**
Code-heavy testing often complicates agile workflows due to manual test scripting, debugging, and execution.

### 3. **Scalability Issues**
Maintaining script-based testing frameworks is labor-intensive, affecting scalability in rapidly evolving codebases.

### 4. **Weak Collaboration**
Non-technical team members face challenges contributing to testing processes in traditional QA systems, leading to communication gaps.

### 5. **Cost Constraints**
Investments in skilled testers, maintenance-heavy scripts, and slow testing cycles strain budgets—especially for small businesses.
