## Common QA Challenges for Small Teams

### 1. **Budget Limitations**
SMEs and startups often can’t afford costly QA tools or dedicated testers, relying on team members who may not specialize in quality assurance.

### 2. **Lack of Time**
Small teams face tight deadlines to launch new features, which limits their ability to thoroughly test software.

### 3. **Skill Gaps**
QA requires specialized skills—but development teams frequently lack the expertise to plan and execute comprehensive testing.

### 4. **Scaling Issues**
As products grow in complexity, startups can find it overwhelming to maintain high-quality testing without flexible processes.
